Why

Since cryptocurrency is very complicated for most of the people that have never used it, this application has been made in order for them to be able to chat freely with their friends but easily send and receive transcations.

I've heard many stories where wrong copy pasting of address has resulted in pretty big amount of loss of funds so I decided to try to remove that.

Moving forward

Due to limited amount of time, there are many things that I wanted to, but didn't get a chance to implement. Better UI is one of them.

Other updates will be posted here as well. Please consider that since this app has been made pretty quickly, there might be some existing bugs that I've not yet noticed so I'd be appreative if I'd get some feedback from you guys.
